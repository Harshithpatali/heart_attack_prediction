# Heart Attack Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and preventive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used is [source or description, e.g., Kaggle Heart Attack Dataset], containing features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Model saving and serialization
